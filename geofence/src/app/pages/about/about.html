    <h4 class="ion-padding-start">Automatic Chronological Geo-fencing For Personal Security</h4>

    <p class="ion-padding-start ion-padding-end">

      Geo-fence is a virtual perimeter for a real world geographic area. A geo-fence could be dynamically generated as
      in a radius
      around a point location or a geo-fence can be a predefined set of boundaries. The use of geo-fence is called
      geo-fencing.
      In our system its usage involves a location aware device of a location based service user exiting a geo-fence.
      This activity could trigger an alert to watcher. This alert will help the watcher to keep track of user.
      This information, which could contain the location of the device could be send to a mobile phone or an email
      account.
      This system is going to generate geo-fence automatically using Association Rule Mining (Frequent Pattern Tree
      Algorithm).
      This system is best suited for personal security. Location based alert is a feature in this system that uses
      global positioning
      system identification to send alerts on exiting the geo-fence.
      Program incorporate geo-fencing allow system to set up triggers so when a device exits the boundaries defined by
      the geo-fence,
      a text message or email alert is sent.
      In our system boundaries are defined by longitude and latitude. This system overcomes the limitation of all
      previous systems in
      which geo-fence is defined by user manually.
